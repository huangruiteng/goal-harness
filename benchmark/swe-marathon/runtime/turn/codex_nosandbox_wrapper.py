"""A `codex` stand-in that drops LoopX's sandbox flags before running the real one.

LoopX's codex-cli host is the path that works: driven through it, a Turn loop
ran four times on one task, committed a 22 KB patch and scored f2p 31/35.  Its
one problem is the sandbox — it always passes `--sandbox <mode>` (or
`-c sandbox_mode=...` when resuming), only permits read-only and
workspace-write, and both need bubblewrap, which needs unprivileged user
namespaces these containers do not have:

    bwrap: No permissions to create a new namespace

Switching to `--host generic-cli` avoided that but bought a worse problem: the
generic host carries its own scheduler contract, and eleven of sixteen turns
died at "LoopX Turn route is not host executable" before any model work, with
no route recorded to explain why.

So keep the working host and fix the flag instead.  This sits earlier on PATH
than the real codex, strips the sandbox arguments, and substitutes the same
`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` the other two arms already use —
which is also what keeps the three arms identical in permissions.  LoopX's
contracts are untouched: it still believes it is driving codex-cli, because it
is.

Set MR_REAL_CODEX to the real binary; defaults to /usr/local/bin/codex.
MR_LOOPX_CODEX_LOG names the log file; defaults to /tmp/loopx-goal/codex-wrapper.log.
