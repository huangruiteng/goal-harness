# Lark Provider

The bundled `loopx-lark` extension supplies optional Lark execution and
presentation providers. It does not replace LoopX goal, todo, gate, quota,
evidence, or recovery authority.

## Provided capabilities

| Capability | Outcome | Primary implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lark-event-inbox` | Collect, inspect, reply to, and acknowledge bounded project feedback | [`event_inbox.py`](event_inbox.py), [`event_collector.py`](event_collector.py) |
| `lark-reviewer-notification` | Send and verify a reviewer notification through a project-dedicated Lark app | [`reviewer_notification.py`](reviewer_notification.py) |
| `lark-kanban-projection` | Render public-safe LoopX todo and control-plane projections into Lark Base | [`presentation/kanban.py`](presentation/kanban.py) |
| `lark-goal-channel` | Bind one verified Lark group and projection surface to one LoopX goal | [`goal_channel.py`](goal_channel.py), [`goal_channel_setup.py`](goal_channel_setup.py) |
| `lark-explore-projection` | Project canonical Explore results into Lark tables, cards, and whiteboards | [`presentation/explore_results.py`](presentation/explore_results.py) |
| `lark-periodic-report-announcement` | Deliver a periodic report through the current Goal Channel's verified project Bot while mentioning only recipients selected by its typed audience plan | [`periodic_report_delivery.py`](periodic_report_delivery.py) |
| `lark-miaoda-html-report` | Publish an already-rendered periodic report to an operator-selected existing Miaoda app | [`presentation/periodic_report.py`](presentation/periodic_report.py) |

Mention-bearing text delivery is owned by the extension's shared outbound
contract in [`outbound.py`](outbound.py). Inbox replies and reviewer
notifications use the same structured `<at ...>` construction, provider
dry-run, and exact readback rule. A visible literal `@Name`, successful message
creation, or matching display text is not mention-delivery evidence. The
provider readback must expose exactly the identities requested at send time in
`mentions[]`; missing, extra, ambiguous, or different identities fail closed.
Callers that need notification semantics must use these extension surfaces
instead of invoking a raw `lark-cli` send command.

For an inbox-configured Bot, preview and verify one proactive top-level message
with the same contract used by replies. A multi-chat collector requires its
public-safe `route_key`; a single inbox accepts the default route:

```bash
loopx lark-inbox send \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --agent-id <agent-id> \
  --route-key project-feedback \
  --text '<at open_id="ou_example">Example Reviewer</at> please review' \
  --provider-preflight

loopx lark-inbox send \
  --goal-id <goal-id> \
  --agent-id <agent-id> \
  --route-key project-feedback \
  --text '<at open_id="ou_example">Example Reviewer</at> please review' \
  --execute
```

The command uses only the owner-local profile and chat already bound to the
selected inbox route. It resolves every structured identity against exact chat
membership, performs a provider dry-run, sends idempotently, and reads the
created message back. It returns no profile, chat id, message body, or raw
provider payload. Installation and the command itself grant no new Lark scope
or external-write authority.

The [event inbox guide](docs/lark-event-inbox.md) documents the complete
collector, processing, reply, reaction, and acknowledgement lifecycle. The
[Lark Kanban integration guide](../../../docs/integrations/lark-kanban-control-plane-adapter.md)
documents projection configuration and lineage.

### Bounded group-history catch-up

The event inbox can reconcile messages that predate the live event collector.
Each invocation reads one ascending page from one configured `route_key` and
previews the inbox/cursor transition by default. `--execute` first persists and
reads back every canonical inbox event, then advances an owner-local cursor:

```bash
loopx lark-inbox history-catch-up \
  --project . \
  --config .loopx/config/lark-collector.json \
  --route-key project-feedback \
  --start 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z

loopx lark-inbox history-catch-up \
  --project . \
  --config .loopx/config/lark-collector.json \
  --route-key project-feedback \
  --start 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z \
  --execute
```

Retries resume the exact private page token, and a completed window replays
without another provider read. A caller may extend one completed history
window to an earlier start once; the provider covers only the missing earlier
window and rejects later source/config drift. The returned link-evidence packet
contains URL plus message and route lineage for the owner-local Agent, but not
the surrounding message body, sender, chat id, profile, cursor, or raw provider
payload. Inbox and cursor directories are restricted to the owner, and their
state files are written with mode `0600`. Product-specific URL classification
and field-enrichment policy remain with the consuming product or private skill.

The cursor binding includes the route key, Bot profile, chat, inbox config,
resolved inbox destination, and capture scope. If any of those inputs changes,
catch-up fails closed with `Lark group-history cursor source binding changed`
before reading the provider. Restore the original route to resume, or move the
owner-local `.loopx/inbox/.history/<route-key>.json` cursor aside and restart
from an explicit `--start`; canonical message ids keep inbox ingestion
idempotent while the replacement cursor rebuilds coverage.

Group-history reads use the configured Bot identity and require the Bot to be a
member of the group, the application to be published, and
`im:message:readonly` plus `im:chat:read`. Permission error `230027` is returned
as typed `group_history_permission_required`; it never advances the inbox or
cursor.

## Lifecycle

Install the bundled provider explicitly, then read back its readiness:

```bash
loopx extension install --bundled loopx-lark --execute --format json
loopx extension doctor loopx-lark --execute --format json
loopx capability list --format json
```

Disable or roll back the provider without changing the owning capabilities or
Kernel state:

```bash
loopx extension disable loopx-lark --execute --format json
loopx extension rollback loopx-lark --execute --format json
```

For Miaoda, `loopx periodic-report publish-miaoda --request-json <path>` first
previews a typed hosted-delivery intent. Add `--execute` only after checking the
profile-bound sink, request-selected app, and artifact. The command delegates
authentication and the external publish/readback calls to `lark-cli`; LoopX
stores no credentials and does not treat local HTML generation as hosted
delivery.

For a Lark report announcement, the Periodic Report profile owns symbolic
recipients, domains, and typed routing rules. The core compiles the relevance
plan without provider identities. Preview performs no identity lookup or send;
execute resolves only selected recipients and omits unrelated recipients. Raw
`<at>` markup in report content or card metadata cannot bypass that policy.
The Goal Channel delivery command accepts exactly two ordered HTTPS entries
(hosted report, then Lark document), emits two independently idempotent
messages, and verifies the native sender App plus exact chat for each readback.

Installation controls discoverability and provider lifecycle only. Every
private chat, app, group, Base, document, or Miaoda target remains in ignored
local configuration. External writes still require the owning capability's
exact authority, gate, revision, idempotency, and readback contract.

## Document-comment Connector provider

`document_comment_provider.py` adapts one owner-configured Lark document to the
provider-neutral Agent external Connector runtime. It delegates authentication
and API calls to `lark-cli`, probes the exact comment read/create scopes, and
turns one bounded comment or nested-reply page into owner-local inbox events.
The adapter requires `lark-cli` 1.0.69 or newer for `drive +list-comments`;
older binaries fail closed and must be upgraded before the Connector is ready.
The provider supports configured-source and incremental capture. It rejects
`addressed_only` until a caller supplies an explicit mention-identity contract;
it never guesses that every document comment addressed the Agent.

Lark comment pagination has separate cursors for comment cards and replies.
The adapter persists both phases in the private Connector cursor and restarts a
completed scan from the first comment page, relying on stable hashed event ids
and the generic inbox for deduplication. A response-capable binding must also
configure an owner-local reply receipt store. Reply creation writes a pending
receipt, reads the exact reply back, then marks the receipt verified; only that
verified receipt lets the generic runtime ACK the event. Solved and
whole-document comment cards are skipped for source-thread response bindings
because the provider does not permit replies to them.

Document URLs, `lark-cli` profiles, provider cursors, comment/reply ids, raw
payloads, and reply receipts remain owner-local. Public status reports only
permission readiness, operation counts, inbox health, and content-free failure
codes. The required provider scopes are
`docs:document.comment:read` for history/readback and
`docs:document.comment:create` for replies; enabling the extension does not
grant either scope or publish an app.

## Ownership boundary

- The extension owns Lark authentication checks, provider dispatch, bounded
  payload conversion, delivery receipts, and readback.
- Outcome capabilities such as Issue Fix, Explore, and Periodic Report own the
  domain request and interpret provider receipts.
- The Kernel alone accepts durable todo, gate, quota, evidence, and recovery
  transitions.
- Lark projections are sinks. They never become the control-plane source of
  truth.

The declarative capability and permission surface is maintained in
[`extension.toml`](extension.toml). Provider readiness never grants a new
permission or silently enables an external write.
