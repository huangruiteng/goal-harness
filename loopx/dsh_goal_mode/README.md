# LoopX DeepSeek Harness (dsh) goal mode

First-class host adapter that turns a DeepSeek Harness session into a
LoopX-governed goal loop. LoopX keeps authority (goal/todo state, quota,
validation); the adapter only translates one governed Turn into one bounded
dsh work segment and shapes the reply into a typed result.

## Surface

The `deepseek-harness` host surface (aliases: `deepseek_harness`,
`DeepSeek Harness`, `dsh`) is an external loop driver:

1. `loopx start-goal --guided --project . --host-surface deepseek-harness`
   returns the host-loop activation packet after todo writeback.
2. Every automatic tick starts from `loopx quota should-run`
   (`--runtime-profile generic_cli`) and stops when it says stop.
3. Each approved tick runs `loopx turn run-once` with this adapter as the
   generic-cli host adapter command.
4. The adapter reads one `loopx_turn_host_request_v0` JSON object on stdin,
   extracts the signed TurnEnvelope authority, asks dsh to execute the bounded
   `primary_action`, and emits exactly one `loopx_turn_result_v0` JSON object
   on stdout.
5. LoopX validates the typed result independently before writing any state or
   spending quota.

## Run the adapter

```bash
python -m loopx.dsh_goal_mode \
  --cordis /path/to/cordis.yml \
  --model deepseek-v4-flash \
  --provider deepseek-official
```

The historical launcher still works and resolves to the same implementation:

```bash
python3 scripts/dsh_turn_host_adapter.py --cordis /path/to/cordis.yml
```

Flags: `--provider`, `--model`, `--max-tokens`, `--workspace`,
`--dsh-home` (`--session-root` remains a compatibility alias), `--cordis`,
`--runtime-bin`, `--request-timeout-seconds`, and `--dsh-runner`. The runner
option is an explicit test hook; LoopX does not machine-enforce where it may be
used, and the caller already owns local host-execution authority.

## In-process host (`--host dsh`)

`loopx turn run-once --host dsh` runs the same adapter inside the CLI process
instead of a generic subprocess. Provider failures then reach the Turn
journal as typed `loopx_turn_host_failure_v0` kinds instead of collapsing to
`unknown` through a bare nonzero exit, so bounded same-Turn retry stays
available. Both failure shapes are covered: a raised transport exception and
the SDK's normal terminal report (`RunResult.finish_reason == "error"` with a
structured `turn/end` reason and no Python exception at all).

Classification follows the `loopx-turn-v0` precedence: a known provider
`error.code` wins over HTTP status and prose, an unknown non-empty code fails
closed to `unknown` and blocks every lower tier, HTTP status decides only
when no more specific code exists, and bounded message matching applies only
when no structured signal exists. Signals that disagree within one tier fold
to `unknown`. The SDK's stable `SERVER` code covers HTTP 5xx responses and maps
to the retryable `provider_overloaded` bucket even when an intermediate
serializer omits the duplicate HTTP status. Its hard-quota `QUOTA` code remains
non-retryable, while its explicitly retryable `EMPTY_RESPONSE` code maps to the
closest LoopX transient bucket, `transport_lost`.

CLI flags: `--dsh-provider`, `--dsh-model`, `--dsh-max-tokens`,
`--dsh-home`, `--dsh-cordis`, `--dsh-runtime-bin`, and `--dsh-runner`.
Against the current SDK config surface the home maps to `dsh_home`, the runtime
binary maps to `dsh_bin`, and a cordis file rides as one `patches` entry.
Home precedence is explicit CLI value, then `DSH_HOME`, then
`<workspace>/.local/.dsh-sessions`; LoopX creates the selected local directory
before SDK launch. Session persistence still belongs to the selected dsh
composition, so this mode does not promise cross-turn dsh session continuity.
The generic-cli subprocess preserves its legacy contract: an exception-free
terminal SDK error produces a typed `wait` result, while the in-process host
turns the same outcome into a retry-aware host failure. Hermetic verification:
`python3 examples/loopx-turn-dsh-builtin-host-e2e-smoke.py`.

The SDK derives `finish_reason` from the last `turn/end.reason.kind`; the
adapter rejects contradictory or malformed runner outcomes as
`contract_rejected`. Result parsing and shaping failures use the same typed
contract failure instead of collapsing into `unknown`.

## Requirements

- Optional dependency group `loopx[deepseek-harness]`, currently pinned to the
  validated `deepseek-harness-sdk==0.1.2a3` API, or a compatible runner via
  `--dsh-runner`.
- A dsh `cordis.yml` plus any `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`
  settings for the real runtime.
- Defaults come from `DSH_MODEL` / `DSH_PROVIDER` when set. `DSH_HOME` may
  override the workspace-local home when no CLI home is supplied.

## Boundary

The explicit dsh runtime home (default `<workspace>/.local/.dsh-sessions`)
stays local and never enters public LoopX evidence. The composition, not this
path name, owns session persistence. The adapter never reads goal/todo state,
builds prompts from todo ids, writes LoopX state, spends quota, or validates
its own work. A valid final response with no typed JSON candidate becomes a
conservative `wait`; an invalid runner/result shape is a typed
`contract_rejected` host failure. Neither path may spend quota.

The adapter derives a stable owner-local session id, but LoopX does not yet
project or validate a DSH Host Session Binding. The built-in surface therefore
does not claim managed supervisor recovery, outer wake/timer ownership, or a
cross-process resume guarantee.

See `docs/integrations/deepseek-harness-connector.md` for the full connector
walkthrough and `examples/dsh-turn-host-adapter-smoke.py` plus
`examples/loopx-turn-dsh-e2e-smoke.py` for hermetic smokes. With the optional
SDK installed, run `examples/loopx-turn-dsh-real-e2e-smoke.py` once with
`--host generic-cli` and once with `--host dsh`; both paths clear ambient DSH
home variables and prove the explicit SDK-home wiring.
