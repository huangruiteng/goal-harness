# Goal Harness Meta Goal

## Objective

Keep the public Goal Harness project healthy enough that another local Codex
thread can bootstrap a goal, inspect registry and run history, check public
boundary safety, and render a first-screen status queue without relying on any
private project context.

## Current Scope

- Keep `scripts/install-local.sh`, `goal-harness bootstrap`,
  `goal-harness check`, `goal-harness status`, and
  `goal-harness serve-status` runnable from a fresh clone.
- Keep docs and examples aligned with the current CLI surface.
- Keep public examples sanitized: no local user paths, private documents,
  credentials, raw logs, or internal task identifiers.
- Treat project-specific adapters as private until their contract is generic
  enough to document publicly.

## Next Action

- Use `goal-harness new-project-prompt --project <PROJECT_ROOT> --goal-doc
  <GOAL_DOC_PATH>` for the next real project handoff. The receiving shell should
  pass the CLI preflight, connect with `--goal-doc`, and then verify registry,
  status, check, and dashboard attention queue visibility.

## Recent Progress

- 2026-06-01T11:43:29+08:00: Added `docs/status-data-contract.md`,
  linked it from README / architecture / attention queue / integration docs,
  pushed the public commit, and saved a compact self-health run with
  `health_check=22/22`.
- 2026-06-01T11:48:36+08:00: Added
  `examples/render-status-dashboard.py`, documented the static dashboard demo,
  and validated that `examples/status.example.json` renders to a local HTML
  dashboard with user/controller, Codex-ready, and external-evidence lanes.
- 2026-06-01T11:59:59+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md`, reframed the single-file HTML
  renderer as a diagnostic fallback, and selected a React/Vite/shadcn/TanStack
  stack for the product dashboard after benchmarking observability and
  orchestration consoles.
- 2026-06-01T12:05:18+08:00: Scaffolded `apps/dashboard` as a Vite + React +
  TypeScript app that reads `examples/status.example.json`, validates it with
  Zod, renders status lanes, metrics, a Recharts queue chart, and a sortable
  TanStack Table behind URL-backed TanStack Router filters.
- 2026-06-01T12:15:37+08:00: Validated the dashboard scaffold with
  `npm --prefix apps/dashboard run build`, browser smoke checks for the
  `Goal Operations` screen, and a public contract scan over the repo. Updated
  the contract scanner to skip `node_modules` so the new npm app remains
  compatible with `--scan-root .`.
- 2026-06-01T12:21:11+08:00: Added dashboard status source controls. The app
  now keeps `examples/status.example.json` as a fallback, accepts a
  URL-backed status source through `statusUrl`, loads imported JSON files, and
  validates every loaded payload with the same Zod status data contract.
- 2026-06-01T12:28:37+08:00: Validated the status source path with a generated
  `apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json` export and a browser smoke check at
  `?statusUrl=/status.local.json`. Added dashboard docs plus a `.gitignore`
  guard so local status exports stay untracked.
- 2026-06-01T12:37:47+08:00: Added `goal-harness serve-status`, a loopback HTTP
  server for live dashboard status JSON with `/status.json`, `/healthz`,
  no-store responses, and local CORS headers. The React dashboard now has a
  default `Live` source path for `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`.
- 2026-06-01T12:47:47+08:00: Added compact run-history to the public
  `goal-harness status` contract, stripping local artifact paths while exposing
  recent classifications, health check summaries, and JSON/Markdown artifact
  availability. The React dashboard now lets an operator select an attention
  queue row and inspect the corresponding run-history detail panel.
- 2026-06-01T13:00:03+08:00: Added `contract.checks` to the public status data
  contract, rendered contract health detail in the React dashboard and the
  static HTML fallback, refreshed the dashboard visual baseline toward a
  product control-plane UI, and recorded the next experiment-controller
  milestone in `docs/experiment-controller-milestone.md`.
- 2026-06-01T13:13:04+08:00: Added the first public experiment-controller
  contract slice: `goal-harness status` now whitelists compact `human_reward`
  fields, maps `needs_human_reward`, `inspect_result`, and
  `blocked_by_safety` classifications into the attention queue, and the React
  dashboard plus static HTML fallback show human reward signals in run history.
  Added sanitized experiment-controller run and reward examples.
- 2026-06-01T13:32:10+08:00: Added compact `controller_readiness` to the
  public status contract, React dashboard, and static HTML fallback. Run
  history can now show whether an experiment controller is ready for read-only
  observation, decision advice, or write control, plus the missing gate names
  and compact gate reviews. Updated sanitized examples and milestone docs.
- 2026-06-01T13:44:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness reward`, a generic operator
  feedback writer that appends compact `human_reward` overlays to a goal run
  index without rewriting private run payloads. Updated run-history loading to
  merge later overlay rows for the same run key, documented the command in
  README / integration / status contract / experiment-controller milestone,
  and added private-looking text rejection for reward summaries.
- 2026-06-01T14:45:00+08:00: Added the first multi-project dashboard
  navigation surface. `goal-harness status` now exposes public-safe goal
  `domain` in compact run history, the React dashboard renders a first-screen
  `Goal Directory` across all known goals, and the old queue mix chart was
  removed so attention lanes and run-history drill-down stay focused.
- 2026-06-01T15:00:00+08:00: Added a local-only `Reward CLI Draft` to the
  dashboard run-history panel. It is generated from the selected goal, latest
  compact run timestamp, registry, and runtime root; defaults to `--dry-run`;
  and keeps browser-side reward writes out of scope until the same safety checks
  are enforced locally.
- 2026-06-01T15:08:00+08:00: Added local reward dry-run validation for the
  dashboard. `goal-harness serve-status` now exposes `POST /reward/dry-run`,
  the React run-history panel can validate selected goal/run reward drafts
  against that loopback endpoint, and the response is compact with
  `appended=false` and no private artifact paths.
- 2026-06-01T15:18:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md` to define the future browser reward
  append gate. The design requires an explicit server write flag, loopback-only
  binding, a browser capability token, exact run targeting, a dry-run preview
  handshake, stale-preview rejection, compact responses, and validation that the
  index changes only on a reviewed append path.
- 2026-06-01T15:37:00+08:00: Added queue-level controller gate hints and a
  reusable new-project Codex handoff prompt. `goal-harness status` now lifts
  compact `controller_stage`, `missing_gates`, and `next_handoff_condition`
  into attention queue items so a multi-project operator can see why a watched
  goal is not ready without opening the run payload. The React dashboard,
  static HTML fallback, status contract, and sanitized examples render those
  gate hints. Added `docs/new-project-codex-prompt.md` and linked it from
  README and integration docs.
- 2026-06-01T15:47:30+08:00: Added `goal-harness new-project-prompt`, a CLI
  generator for the Chinese Codex handoff prompt used to connect a project from
  a project folder plus goal document. The generated command defaults to a
  read-only adapter and omits `--next-probe` unless a real read-only pre-tick
  command is provided.
- 2026-06-01T16:04:18+08:00: Added `scripts/install-local.sh` so a fresh local
  checkout can install `goal-harness` into `~/.local/bin` and add that directory
  to the shell profile. Also added `connect --goal-doc` as a primary authority
  source in registry and initial state, and updated `new-project-prompt` to run
  a CLI preflight before project connection.

  user shell can resolve the CLI from any project directory

  status contract, and experiment-controller milestone docs

## Guards

- Do not copy private registry entries, project paths, document links, task ids,
  credentials, or raw run payloads into public examples.
- Keep runtime data local; commit only sanitized docs, source, and examples.
- Prefer small, verified public-facing changes over broad rewrites.
