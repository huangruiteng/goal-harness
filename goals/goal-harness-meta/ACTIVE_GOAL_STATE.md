# Goal Harness Meta Goal

## Objective

Keep the public Goal Harness project healthy enough that another local Codex
thread can bootstrap a goal, inspect registry and run history, check public
boundary safety, and render a first-screen status queue without relying on any
private project context.

## Current Scope

- Keep `scripts/install-local.sh`, `goal-harness bootstrap`,
  `goal-harness check`, `goal-harness status`, `goal-harness archive-runtime`,
  and `goal-harness serve-status` runnable from a fresh clone.
- Keep docs and examples aligned with the current CLI surface.
- Keep public examples sanitized: no local user paths, private documents,
  credentials, raw logs, or internal task identifiers.
- Treat project-specific adapters as private until their contract is generic
  enough to document publicly.

## Next Action

- Use `docs/state-interaction-model.md` as the gate before adding more
  controller, reward, adapter, or dashboard features. The next implementation
  slice should make first-screen `User Actions` cards expose the matching safe
  CLI path or reward draft hint inline while preserving the boundary that
  dashboard is user-facing and CLI status is agent-facing machine state. The
  operator should see the next concrete local step without opening run-history
  detail.

## Recent Progress

- 2026-06-01T11:43:29+08:00: Added `docs/status-data-contract.md`,
  linked it from README / architecture / attention queue / integration docs,
  pushed the public commit, and saved a compact self-health run with
  `health_check=22/22`.
- 2026-06-01T11:48:36+08:00: Added
  `examples/render-status-dashboard.py`, documented the static dashboard demo,
  and validated that `examples/status.example.json` renders to a local HTML
  dashboard with user/controller, Codex-ready, and external-evidence lanes.
- 2026-06-01T11:59:59+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-frontend-selection.md`, reframed the single-file HTML
  renderer as a diagnostic fallback, and selected a React/Vite/shadcn/TanStack
  stack for the product dashboard after benchmarking observability and
  orchestration consoles.
- 2026-06-01T12:05:18+08:00: Scaffolded `apps/dashboard` as a Vite + React +
  TypeScript app that reads `examples/status.example.json`, validates it with
  Zod, renders status lanes, metrics, a Recharts queue chart, and a sortable
  TanStack Table behind URL-backed TanStack Router filters.
- 2026-06-01T12:15:37+08:00: Validated the dashboard scaffold with
  `npm --prefix apps/dashboard run build`, browser smoke checks for the
  `Goal Operations` screen, and a public contract scan over the repo. Updated
  the contract scanner to skip `node_modules` so the new npm app remains
  compatible with `--scan-root .`.
- 2026-06-01T12:21:11+08:00: Added dashboard status source controls. The app
  now keeps `examples/status.example.json` as a fallback, accepts a
  URL-backed status source through `statusUrl`, loads imported JSON files, and
  validates every loaded payload with the same Zod status data contract.
- 2026-06-01T12:28:37+08:00: Validated the status source path with a generated
  `apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json` export and a browser smoke check at
  `?statusUrl=/status.local.json`. Added dashboard docs plus a `.gitignore`
  guard so local status exports stay untracked.
- 2026-06-01T12:37:47+08:00: Added `goal-harness serve-status`, a loopback HTTP
  server for live dashboard status JSON with `/status.json`, `/healthz`,
  no-store responses, and local CORS headers. The React dashboard now has a
  default `Live` source path for `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`.
- 2026-06-01T12:47:47+08:00: Added compact run-history to the public
  `goal-harness status` contract, stripping local artifact paths while exposing
  recent classifications, health check summaries, and JSON/Markdown artifact
  availability. The React dashboard now lets an operator select an attention
  queue row and inspect the corresponding run-history detail panel.
- 2026-06-01T13:00:03+08:00: Added `contract.checks` to the public status data
  contract, rendered contract health detail in the React dashboard and the
  static HTML fallback, refreshed the dashboard visual baseline toward a
  product control-plane UI, and recorded the next experiment-controller
  milestone in `docs/experiment-controller-milestone.md`.
- 2026-06-01T13:13:04+08:00: Added the first public experiment-controller
  contract slice: `goal-harness status` now whitelists compact `human_reward`
  fields, maps `needs_human_reward`, `inspect_result`, and
  `blocked_by_safety` classifications into the attention queue, and the React
  dashboard plus static HTML fallback show human reward signals in run history.
  Added sanitized experiment-controller run and reward examples.
- 2026-06-01T13:32:10+08:00: Added compact `controller_readiness` to the
  public status contract, React dashboard, and static HTML fallback. Run
  history can now show whether an experiment controller is ready for read-only
  observation, decision advice, or write control, plus the missing gate names
  and compact gate reviews. Updated sanitized examples and milestone docs.
- 2026-06-01T13:44:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness reward`, a generic operator
  feedback writer that appends compact `human_reward` overlays to a goal run
  index without rewriting private run payloads. Updated run-history loading to
  merge later overlay rows for the same run key, documented the command in
  README / integration / status contract / experiment-controller milestone,
  and added private-looking text rejection for reward summaries.
- 2026-06-01T14:45:00+08:00: Added the first multi-project dashboard
  navigation surface. `goal-harness status` now exposes public-safe goal
  `domain` in compact run history, the React dashboard renders a first-screen
  `Goal Directory` across all known goals, and the old queue mix chart was
  removed so attention lanes and run-history drill-down stay focused.
- 2026-06-01T15:00:00+08:00: Added a local-only `Reward CLI Draft` to the
  dashboard run-history panel. It is generated from the selected goal, latest
  compact run timestamp, registry, and runtime root; defaults to `--dry-run`;
  and keeps browser-side reward writes out of scope until the same safety checks
  are enforced locally.
- 2026-06-01T15:08:00+08:00: Added local reward dry-run validation for the
  dashboard. `goal-harness serve-status` now exposes `POST /reward/dry-run`,
  the React run-history panel can validate selected goal/run reward drafts
  against that loopback endpoint, and the response is compact with
  `appended=false` and no private artifact paths.
- 2026-06-01T15:18:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md` to define the future browser reward
  append gate. The design requires an explicit server write flag, loopback-only
  binding, a browser capability token, exact run targeting, a dry-run preview
  handshake, stale-preview rejection, compact responses, and validation that the
  index changes only on a reviewed append path.
- 2026-06-01T15:37:00+08:00: Added queue-level controller gate hints and a
  reusable new-project Codex handoff prompt. `goal-harness status` now lifts
  compact `controller_stage`, `missing_gates`, and `next_handoff_condition`
  into attention queue items so a multi-project operator can see why a watched
  goal is not ready without opening the run payload. The React dashboard,
  static HTML fallback, status contract, and sanitized examples render those
  gate hints. Added `docs/new-project-codex-prompt.md` and linked it from
  README and integration docs.
- 2026-06-01T15:47:30+08:00: Added `goal-harness new-project-prompt`, a CLI
  generator for the Chinese Codex handoff prompt used to connect a project from
  a project folder plus goal document. The generated command defaults to a
  read-only adapter and omits `--next-probe` unless a real read-only pre-tick
  command is provided.
- 2026-06-01T16:04:18+08:00: Added `scripts/install-local.sh` so a fresh local
  checkout can install `goal-harness` into `~/.local/bin` and add that directory
  to the shell profile; `scripts/goal-harness` now resolves symlink targets so
  the installed wrapper still finds the real repository root. Also added
  `connect --goal-doc` as a primary authority source in registry and initial
  state, and updated `new-project-prompt` to run a CLI preflight before project
  connection.
- 2026-06-01T16:12:12+08:00: Added `goal-harness doctor` to diagnose local CLI
  installation, PATH, symlink realpath, wrapper script, and Python import
  health. The installer and new-project handoff now call `goal-harness doctor`
  instead of `--help`, so future connection failures expose a structured fix
  rather than stopping at a missing command.
- 2026-06-01T16:22:59+08:00: Made actionable unregistered runtime goals visible
  in the public attention queue as `unregistered_runtime_goal`. This keeps
  multi-project dashboard status authoritative when a new project has saved run
  history before registry connection, while watch-only legacy records remain in
  run history without becoming queue work.
- 2026-06-01T16:32:48+08:00: Added `goal-harness archive-runtime` as the
  cleanup path for obsolete runtime-only goals. It defaults to dry-run, requires
  `--execute` before moving files, protects registry members by default, and
  moves reviewed runtime directories under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`.
- 2026-06-01T16:58:24+08:00: Added `goal-harness refresh-state`, a state-only
  run writer for the case where a controller updated active state, ledger, or
  planning docs without running a project adapter. `status` now maps the compact
  `state_refreshed` classification to Codex-ready work, the new-project handoff
  prompt teaches receiving sessions to run the refresh when dashboard still
  shows an old run, and the latest zero-start project was connected into the
  local multi-project registry so it appears as `state_refreshed -> codex`
  instead of an unregistered runtime goal.
- 2026-06-01T17:07:01+08:00: Replaced the manual multi-project registry patch
  with automatic global-registry sync. `goal-harness connect` and
  `goal-harness refresh-state` now merge local project registry entries into
  `~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json`; `status` falls back to that
  global registry when no project-local registry exists; and
  `goal-harness sync-global` exists for explicit diagnosis or recovery. The
  global registry strips raw authority-source details while keeping local paths
  private under the shared runtime root.
- 2026-06-01T17:16:09+08:00: Added the public
  `skills/goal-harness-project/SKILL.md` and taught `scripts/install-local.sh`
  to install or update it under `~/.codex/skills/goal-harness-project` by
  default. The skill captures the agent-side workflow for project connect,
  state refresh, global sync, validation, private boundary, and Chinese review
  reporting.
- 2026-06-01T17:36:10+08:00: Added global-registry health to the public status
  contract and React dashboard. `goal-harness status` now reports
  `global_registry` findings for stale source registries, missing active state
  files, duplicate goal ids, and local-vs-global scope mismatches. CS-Notes
  pre-tick now reads the global registry first-screen status, so a newly
  connected read-only project appears as `state_refreshed -> codex` instead of
  a local-registry ghost.
- 2026-06-01T17:55:00+08:00: Fixed `status` / `serve-status` default contract
  scan boundaries. Multi-project status can now be run from a private project
  checkout while still checking the public Goal Harness install root by
  default; operators must opt in with `--scan-root` or `--scan-path` before
  scanning a project-specific public surface.
- 2026-06-01T18:02:32+08:00: Improved state-only refresh action quality after
  inspecting a real zero-start project connection. The latest active state had
  a precise next action, but the compact dashboard run still showed the generic
  refresh notice. `refresh-state` now derives the compact `recommended_action`
  from the first public-safe `## Next Action` line, skips private-looking lines
  such as internal document URLs, and falls back to the generic refresh notice
  only when needed. The rendered refresh Markdown also normalizes bullet
  prefixes.
- 2026-06-01T18:24:00+08:00: Added `goal-harness read-only-map`, a generic
  read-only project-map run writer for connected projects. It accepts
  `read_only_project_map_v0` or compatible `*_read_only_map_v0` adapters,
  derives a public-safe dashboard action from active state, records compact map
  counts in run history, and keeps raw project evidence in the private runtime
  payload. Updated status classification, dashboard schema/rendering, docs,
  new-project prompt guidance, and installed skill workflow.
- 2026-06-01T18:36:00+08:00: Added
  `docs/state-interaction-model.md` to define the state boundary between the
  durable goal, Codex App executor, human operator, and dashboard. The document
  names actor ownership, state stores, state transitions, dashboard first-screen
  rules, invariants, and a feature-gate checklist so future work does not add
  isolated commands before the state contract is clear. Linked it from
  `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- 2026-06-01T18:51:00+08:00: Added lifecycle phases to the public status
  contract and dashboard. `goal-harness status` now derives compact
  `lifecycle_phase` / `lifecycle_flags` for attention items, run-history goals,
  and compact runs. The React dashboard validates those fields and renders a
  human-facing `User Review Map` so users see connected, mapped, refreshed,
  adapter-inspected, reward-judged, controller-gated, and controller-ready
  states separately from raw adapter classifications. The docs now clarify that
  CLI status is agent-facing machine state, while the dashboard is the
  operator-facing interpretation layer.
- 2026-06-01T18:58:00+08:00: Added a selected-goal `Operator Decision` panel
  to the React dashboard. The panel derives a human stance from queue item,
  lifecycle phase, readiness gates, and recommended action: review or authorize,
  let Codex continue, wait for evidence, or fix health first. This keeps
  `goal-harness status` as an agent-facing contract while making the dashboard
  answer the user question before showing run-history details.
- 2026-06-01T19:08:36+08:00: Connected `Operator Decision` to a selected-goal
  `Safe CLI Path`. The dashboard now shows the safe local command class for the
  current stance: status/history inspection, `read-only-map --dry-run`,
  `refresh-state --dry-run`, or a reward-gate handoff to the existing Reward CLI
  Draft. The bridge is explicitly read/dry-run oriented and does not add
  browser-side reward append or approval writes.
- 2026-06-01T19:15:23+08:00: Made the dashboard `Reward CLI Draft` derive
  scenario-specific defaults from the selected `Operator Decision` and missing
  gates. Mapped Codex-ready goals default to `use_read_only_map` with a positive
  handoff reward; external-evidence goals missing `human_reward_capture` default
  to `record_human_reward_gate` with the compact handoff condition; controller
  opt-in goals show their gate label but still avoid a reward command when no
  compact run exists. The panel can reset to these defaults after user edits,
  and browser writes remain disabled.
- 2026-06-01T19:21:38+08:00: Promoted operator-derived actions into a
  first-screen `User Actions` summary. The React dashboard now derives compact
  action cards from the same `Operator Decision` and reward-default logic used
  by selected-goal detail, so reward gates, controller opt-ins, evidence
  watches, Codex handoffs, and blocking health items are visible before opening
  a goal. In the current global status, the first screen shows three cards:
  `Record human reward` for `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, `Review controller
  opt-in` for `agent-harness-main-control`, and `Let Codex use the map` for the
  mapped Codex-ready project.

- `curl POST /reward/dry-run` against a synthetic loopback server returns
  `ok=true`, `appended=false`, and leaves the run index row count unchanged
- `goal-harness status` for the local multi-project registry shows
  `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc` with
  `controller_stage=ready_for_read_only_not_decision` and missing gates
  `human_reward_capture`, `aligned_eval_decision_evidence`

- `python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/*.py examples/render-status-dashboard.py`
- Synthetic project: `refresh-state --dry-run` returns `appended=false`, real
  `refresh-state` writes JSON/Markdown/index artifacts, and `status` maps the
  latest run to `state_refreshed -> codex`
- Latest zero-start project registry: `refresh-state --dry-run` reads the
  updated active state with `state_file 1/1`; real refresh appended a
  `state_refreshed` run at `2026-06-01T16:52:57+08:00`
- Multi-project status export now shows the zero-start project as
  `state_refreshed -> codex`

  and verify the latest zero-start project row shows `state_refreshed`, Codex,
  and the refreshed-state action
- Synthetic project: `connect` auto-synced `auto-sync-demo` into a temp
  `registry.global.json`; `refresh-state` re-synced it; and `status` from a
  directory without `.goal-harness/registry.json` fell back to that global
  registry and showed `state_refreshed -> codex`
- Real sync: merged a private local registry and the latest zero-start project
  registry into the shared local global registry
- Default global status: `python3 -m goal_harness.cli --runtime-root
  <runtime-root> --format json status --scan-path README.md --scan-path docs`
  returns the global registry path, 6 goals, and 3 attention items
- Browser smoke: dashboard loaded `/status.local.json` generated from the
  global registry and showed the zero-start project as `state_refreshed`
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh CODEX_HOME=<tmp> scripts/install-local.sh`
  creates both the CLI wrapper and `goal-harness-project` skill symlink
- `scripts/install-local.sh` on the current machine reports a local
  `goal-harness-project` skill install path
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh scripts/install-local.sh` now validates the
  installed wrapper with `goal-harness doctor`
- `goal-harness status` for the local multi-project registry shows a newly
  connected zero-start project as `unregistered_runtime_goal` with controller
  readiness gates, while watch-only legacy runtime records remain out of the
  attention queue
- `HOME=$(mktemp -d) SHELL=/bin/zsh scripts/install-local.sh` writes the
  `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` shell profile block and the installed
  wrapper passes `goal-harness doctor`
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id orphan-goal` against a synthetic
  runtime returns `dry_run=true` and leaves the source directory in place
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id orphan-goal --execute` moves the
  synthetic runtime directory under `<runtime-root>/archived-goals/`
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id registered-goal` rejects a synthetic
  registry member unless `--allow-registered` is explicitly supplied
- `goal-harness archive-runtime --goal-id zero-start-project-goal` dry-runs a
  current unregistered runtime goal cleanup without moving files
- `goal-harness connect --goal-doc docs/GOAL.md` records
  `authority_sources[0].path == "docs/GOAL.md"` in the registry and renders
  `Primary goal document: docs/GOAL.md` in the initial state
- `goal-harness registry` renders `authorities=1` for a goal connected with a
  primary goal document
- Browser smoke: load the dashboard with `/status.local.json`, select
  `tiger-team-maiduidui-regauc`, and verify the queue gate hints plus next
  handoff condition are visible
- Browser smoke: load the React dashboard from a loopback `statusUrl`, click
  `Dry-run Check`, and verify the reward panel shows `validated` with
  `appended=false`
- `docs/dashboard-reward-write-boundary.md` is linked from README, integration,
  status contract, and experiment-controller milestone docs
- `goal-harness --registry ~/.codex/goal-harness/registry.global.json --format
  json status` run from a private project directory returns `ok=true`,
  `contract.summary.errors=0`, and `global_registry.summary.findings=0`
- Synthetic refresh dry-runs prove a public `## Next Action` line becomes the
  compact `recommended_action`, while an internal-document URL line is skipped
  in favor of the next public-safe action
- Real premium refresh at `2026-06-01T18:01:37+08:00` now shows the concrete
  GZXMT evidence-template action in global status and dashboard local JSON

## Guards

- Do not copy private registry entries, project paths, document links, task ids,
  credentials, or raw run payloads into public examples.
- Keep runtime data local; commit only sanitized docs, source, and examples.
- Prefer small, verified public-facing changes over broad rewrites.
