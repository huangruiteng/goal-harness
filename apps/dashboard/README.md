# Goal Harness Dashboard

This is the first product dashboard shell for Goal Harness. It renders the
status data contract with a React/Vite control-plane UI.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The default screen uses the sanitized repository example at
`examples/status.example.json`, including the attention queue and compact run
history drill-down. The dashboard consumes agent-facing `goal-harness status`
JSON, but the first screen is a human operator view: `User Review Map` translates
registry/run/reward/controller signals into review states, while `Goal
Directory` remains the multi-project switcher with public-safe domain,
attention state, latest run, and run counts.
`User Actions` is the first content region because the dashboard is for the
human operator, not for raw status inspection. It lifts the selected-detail
operator logic into the first screen:
reward gates, controller opt-ins, evidence watches, Codex handoffs, and health
blocks are grouped as operator cards before the user opens a goal detail. Each
card also exposes the matching safe local path and reward-draft hint, so the
first screen stays user-facing while still pointing agents toward the CLI
contract. A compact action-kind filter lets the operator focus the first
screen on reward, controller, Codex, evidence, or health work without changing
the underlying status export. The filter is backed by the `actionKind` URL
search parameter, so focused review links survive refresh and can be shared
with another local operator or agent. The selected goal is also URL-backed via
`goalId`, which lets a shared link preserve both the review lane and the
selected goal detail. The adjacent first-screen `Selected action share`
control copies the current `actionKind`, selected `goalId`, source
`statusUrl`, and queue filters as browser UI state only. Each first-screen
action card leads with the project id before the action title, because
operators usually choose by project first and then inspect the requested
action. Each card intentionally has one canonical copy affordance: `Copy`. The
copied handoff starts as a short `【GH Packet】` with the selected card's user
todo, gate, safety boundary, safe path, command, and project-agent stop rule, so
an operator can click a different card to switch the target instead of choosing
among several copy formats.
It is still a handoff artifact; it is not approval, reward append, controller
opt-in, or write-control.
The selected-goal detail starts with `Operator Decision`, which turns the
selected goal's queue item, lifecycle phase, and readiness gates into one of
the user-level stances: review or authorize, let Codex continue, wait for
evidence, or fix health first.
That same panel now includes a `Safe CLI Path`: a local dry-run, history, or
status command that matches the current stance. It is a bridge from
user-facing review to agent-facing CLI execution, not a browser write path.

When a selected goal has a compact run record, the run-history panel also shows
a `Reward CLI Draft`. It is intentionally local-only and defaults to
`--dry-run`; browser writes to private runtime indexes remain disabled unless
the local status server explicitly enables the reward write API. Draft defaults
are derived from the selected `Operator Decision`
and missing gates, so an evidence watch, controller opt-in, mapped handoff, and
already-rewarded run start with different decision/reward/reason/follow-up
values. The operator can still edit or reset the draft before validation.

When the dashboard is loaded from the loopback `Live` source, the same panel can
send that draft to `POST /reward/dry-run` for local validation. The endpoint
returns a compact validation result, the Chinese active-state summary Codex can
write after a real reward append, and the project-agent history command. It
also returns a `preview_id` that locks the selected goal, run, reward payload,
and current raw index count.
If the live server was started with `--enable-reward-write-api`, the dashboard
can then call `POST /reward/append` for that exact preview. The append writes
one run-bound `human_reward` overlay, refreshes status, and leaves the compact
overlay as the source of truth future agents read through `status` or
`history`.
Durable reward should be recorded as a run-bound `human_reward` overlay through
`goal-harness reward`; active state may summarize the reward afterward, but it
should not be the only source of truth for multi-agent reward signals.
When a real CLI append should also update the active goal state, use
`goal-harness reward --write-active-state-summary`; the dashboard append path
sets the same summary-write intent after the operator confirms the preview.

## Load Live Status

Start a local status server from the project you want to inspect:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --port 8765
```

Then run the dashboard and use the `Live` source button, or load this URL from
the source control:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json
```

The status server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and sends no-store JSON with
local CORS headers for the Vite dashboard.

It also serves `POST /reward/dry-run` for validating the selected goal/run and
public-safe reward text. To allow direct local dashboard submission, start the
server with the explicit write flag:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --port 8765 --enable-reward-write-api
```

The write flag is loopback-only. Without it, the dashboard can validate a
reward draft but cannot append feedback.

## Load Static Status

Use a local static export:

```bash
python3 -m goal_harness.cli --format json status > apps/dashboard/public/status.local.json
cd apps/dashboard
npm run dev
```

Then load `/status.local.json` from the dashboard source control.

You can also import a JSON file directly in the browser, or load a local API
URL that returns the same `goal-harness --format json status` shape.

## Browser Smokes

Dashboard browser smokes are explicit because they start a temporary Vite
server and require the local Playwright CLI wrapper:

```bash
node examples/dashboard-throttled-browser-smoke.mjs
node examples/dashboard-operator-gate-browser-smoke.mjs
```

The throttled smoke protects the "quiet scheduling state" first screen. The
operator-gate smoke protects planned high-complexity goals: they should appear
as controller/user actions, not Codex-ready work.
