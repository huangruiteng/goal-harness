# Status Data Contract

`goal-harness --format json status` is the stable first-screen data contract for
agents, heartbeat jobs, dashboards, and local UI experiments.

The command is an export: it reads the registry, compact run indexes, and the
public/private contract check, then emits one JSON object. It does not inspect
private run payloads beyond compact index fields and does not mutate files.

For local dashboards, the same JSON shape can be served over loopback HTTP:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --port 8765
```

The default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8765/status.json`. It is intended for
local dashboard development and includes CORS headers so a Vite app on another
localhost port can fetch it.

The same local server exposes `POST /reward/dry-run` for dashboard reward
validation. It accepts the selected `goal_id`, `run_generated_at`, compact
reward fields, and public-safe summary text, then returns a compact validation
result with `appended=false`. It does not mutate the run index and does not
return private artifact paths.

## Command

```bash
goal-harness --format json status > goal-status.json
```

Use narrow scan paths when a project contains unrelated private files:

```bash
goal-harness --format json status \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

## Top-Level Shape

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "registry": ".goal-harness/registry.json",
  "runtime_root": "./runtime",
  "goal_count": 3,
  "run_count": 2,
  "contract": {
    "ok": true,
    "summary": {
      "errors": 0,
      "warnings": 0,
      "checks": 4
    },
    "errors": [],
    "warnings": [],
    "checks": [
      "registry goals checked: 3",
      "runtime indexes checked: 3",
      "run-history goals=3 runs=2",
      "public boundary scan clean: 12 files"
    ]
  },
  "attention_queue": {
    "available": true,
    "item_count": 2,
    "needs_user_or_controller": 1,
    "needs_controller": 0,
    "needs_codex": 1,
    "watching_external_evidence": 0,
    "items": []
  },
  "run_history": {
    "available": true,
    "goal_count": 3,
    "run_count": 2,
    "goals": [],
    "recent_runs": []
  }
}
```

Consumers should treat unknown fields as additive. Required fields for a
first-screen UI are `ok`, `contract`, and `attention_queue`.

## Contract Health

`contract.ok=false` means the UI should show a blocking health state before
encouraging more adapter work.

The summary counters are intentionally small:

- `errors`: boundary or registry problems that should block progress.
- `warnings`: non-blocking issues worth showing in a secondary health panel.
- `checks`: successful observations, useful for audit trails.

`errors`, `warnings`, and `checks` are short strings. Checks should be concrete
enough to support an operator decision without exposing local paths or private
evidence. They must be public-safe before a project exposes this export outside
the local machine.

## Attention Queue

The attention queue is sorted by Goal Harness status logic. A UI should render
it as the primary worklist.

Counters:

- `item_count`: all visible queue items.
- `needs_user_or_controller`: items waiting on either a human user or a target
  controller.
- `needs_controller`: subset waiting on a target controller or adapter
  connection.
- `needs_codex`: items ready for a Codex action.
- `watching_external_evidence`: items that should be monitored but not acted on
  until outside evidence changes.

Item shape:

```json
{
  "goal_id": "complex-project-main-control",
  "status": "ready_for_controller_opt_in",
  "waiting_on": "user_or_controller",
  "severity": "action",
  "recommended_action": "ask the target controller to opt into a read-only map before any mutation",
  "source": "latest_run"
}
```

Item fields:

- `goal_id`: stable goal identifier from registry or runtime.
- `status`: adapter classification or derived status.
- `waiting_on`: `user_or_controller`, `controller`, `codex`, or
  `external_evidence`.
- `severity`: `high`, `action`, or `watch`.
- `recommended_action`: exactly one next action.
- `source`: `contract`, `registry`, `run_history`, or `latest_run`.

## Run History

`run_history` is a compact, public-safe drill-down surface for the dashboard.
It mirrors the compact run index, but strips local artifact paths. UIs should
show artifact availability with `json_exists` and `markdown_exists` instead of
linking directly to local files.

Goal shape:

```json
{
  "id": "complex-project-main-control",
  "domain": "complex-project-control",
  "status": "active-read-only",
  "registry_member": true,
  "legacy_runtime_goal": false,
  "adapter_kind": "complex_project_read_only_map_v0",
  "adapter_status": "connected-read-only",
  "index_exists": true,
  "raw_index_records": 2,
  "unique_runs": 2,
  "latest_runs": []
}
```

Run shape:

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-05-31T21:15:00+00:00",
  "goal_id": "complex-project-main-control",
  "classification": "ready_for_controller_opt_in",
  "recommended_action": "ask the target controller to opt into a read-only map before any mutation",
  "health_check": "8/8",
  "controller_readiness": {
    "classification": "ready_for_read_only_not_decision",
    "read_only_observer_ready": true,
    "decision_advisor_ready": false,
    "write_controller_ready": false,
    "missing_gates": [
      "human_reward_capture",
      "aligned_eval_decision_evidence"
    ],
    "review_judgment": "safe to connect read-only observation, but not decision advice",
    "next_handoff_condition": "record aligned eval evidence and one human reward event",
    "gates": [
      {
        "id": "durable_goal_context",
        "ok": true,
        "review": "goal state and run history are available"
      },
      {
        "id": "human_reward_capture",
        "ok": false,
        "review": "no operator reward has been recorded yet"
      }
    ]
  },
  "human_reward": {
    "recorded_at": "2026-06-01T00:05:00+00:00",
    "decision": "continue_route",
    "reward": "positive",
    "reason_summary": "operator accepted the route because the comparable metric improved and validation was aligned",
    "follow_up": "promote the route to a longer-window check"
  },
  "json_exists": true,
  "markdown_exists": true
}
```

Optional compact fields such as `active_task_count`, `active_priorities`, and
`cache_check` may appear when an adapter records them. Experiment-controller
adapters may also include compact `controller_readiness` and `human_reward`
summaries.

For `controller_readiness`, the status export keeps only controller-stage
booleans, missing gate names, operator-facing review text, next handoff
condition, and compact gate rows with `id`, `ok`, and `review`. For
`human_reward`, the status export keeps only `recorded_at`, `decision`,
`reward`, `reason_summary`, and `follow_up`; richer evidence belongs in private
run payloads.

Operators can append `human_reward` with the CLI:

```bash
goal-harness reward \
  --goal-id example-experiment-goal \
  --decision continue_route \
  --reward positive \
  --reason-summary "comparable validation improved and the route is worth extending"
```

The command appends a compact overlay row to the goal's `index.jsonl`. History
loading merges later rows with the same run key, so feedback can be added
without rewriting the original run JSON or Markdown payload.

## Display Model

A first useful UI can be built from the export alone:

- Header: `ok`, `goal_count`, `run_count`, and contract summary.
- Goal directory: all `run_history.goals`, grouped mentally by `domain` and
  enriched with matching attention items when a goal needs action.
- Primary queue: `attention_queue.items`.
- User lane: items with `waiting_on=user_or_controller` or `controller`.
- Codex lane: items with `waiting_on=codex`.
- Watch lane: items with `waiting_on=external_evidence`.
- Health panel: contract `errors`, `warnings`, and `checks`.
- Run detail panel: selected goal from the attention queue, compact
  classifications, controller readiness, health checks, reward signals, and
  artifact availability.
- Reward CLI draft: selected goal plus latest compact run timestamp should be
  enough to generate a local `goal-harness reward --dry-run` command. The
  dashboard should not append feedback directly until the local-only evidence
  boundary is explicitly implemented.
- Reward dry-run check: when the dashboard is loaded from a loopback status
  server, it may validate the same draft through `POST /reward/dry-run` and
  display the compact result. This is still a validation path, not a browser
  write path.

Suggested badge mapping:

- `severity=high`: blocking.
- `severity=action`: needs a decision or bounded work segment.
- `severity=watch`: no immediate action; wait for evidence.

## Static Dashboard Demo

The repository includes a no-dependency renderer that turns any status JSON
export into a static HTML dashboard:

```bash
goal-harness --format json status > /tmp/goal-status.json
python3 examples/render-status-dashboard.py /tmp/goal-status.json /tmp/goal-status.html
```

The generated page groups queue items into user/controller, Codex-ready, and
external-evidence lanes. It is a small demo for local inspection and UI
prototyping; it is not the product dashboard.

The official dashboard direction is a React/Vite control-plane app that can
render this same JSON contract with typed routes, filters, tables, charts, and
drill-down pages. See
[dashboard-frontend-selection.md](dashboard-frontend-selection.md).

## Adapter Responsibilities

Adapters should write compact run index records that include:

- `generated_at`
- `goal_id`
- `classification`
- `recommended_action`
- `json_path`
- `markdown_path`

Project adapters may add compact public-safe fields such as `health_check`,
`active_task_count`, `active_priorities`, or a compact `human_reward` summary.
Raw logs, prompts, private metrics, workspace paths, and internal document
links belong in private run payloads, not in compact index records.

## Boundary

The JSON export is safe to feed to a local dashboard only if the registry ids,
adapter classifications, and recommended actions are sanitized. Before sharing
an export publicly, verify that it contains no:

- local absolute user paths,
- private document links,
- credentials,
- raw production logs,
- internal task ids,
- private metric values.

The public examples under `examples/` are sanitized and can be used for demos.

## Compatibility Rules

- Additive fields are allowed.
- Existing field meanings should remain stable across minor versions.
- Consumers should ignore unknown fields.
- Consumers should handle missing `attention_queue.items` as an empty queue.
- Consumers should handle missing `run_history` as unavailable.
- Consumers should treat `contract.ok=false` as a stronger signal than an empty
  attention queue.
