# Getting Started With Goal Harness

This guide carries the operational detail that used to live in the root
README. The root README is now the short product landing page; this page is the
hands-on path for installation, project connection, diagnosis, heartbeats,
dashboard use, development checks, and command discovery.

## Start With An Agent

If you already use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another terminal agent, paste
this into the agent from your project repo:

```text
Install and connect Goal Harness for this project end to end. Do not stop at a
plan.

If `goal-harness` is not on PATH:
- clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness to ~/goal-harness if it is
  not already present;
- run ~/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh;
- export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH".

Then:
1. Run `goal-harness doctor`.
2. Choose a stable goal id from this repo name unless I gave one explicitly.
3. Read the project goal doc if present (`GOAL.md`, `README.md`, or the doc I
   name); otherwise ask me for a one-sentence objective.
4. Run `goal-harness connect` or `goal-harness bootstrap` for this repo with
   that goal id, objective, domain, and goal doc.
5. Read the `Onboarding Scan`, `Proposed Onboarding Candidates`,
   `Accept Candidate Commands`, and `Autonomy Choice` from the connect output.
   Briefly explain the candidate agent todos to me and ask:
   - which candidates I accept, edit, or reject;
   - whether `autonomous=yes`, meaning you may start the first accepted agent
     todo after the quota guard passes.
   Do not make me run the acceptance commands manually; run the accepted
   `goal-harness todo add ...` commands yourself. If I choose
   `autonomous=no`, stop after `goal-harness refresh-state`.
6. Ensure `.goal-harness/` and `.codex/goals/` are ignored in this project.
7. Run `goal-harness registry`, `goal-harness status`, and
   `goal-harness check --scan-root .`.
8. Report the goal id, created files, current user todo, current agent todo,
   and next safe action.

Do not commit `.goal-harness/`, `.codex/goals/`, live ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE files,
runtime registries, raw logs, credentials, or private local paths.
```

For a longer generated handoff prompt, install once and run:

```bash
goal-harness new-project-prompt \
  --project /path/to/your-project \
  --goal-doc /path/to/your-project/GOAL.md
```

The command output is meant to be pasted into Codex or Claude Code. It contains
the full guard, quota, todo, and heartbeat protocol for a new project.

Success looks like this:

- `goal-harness doctor` passes;
- the project has `.goal-harness/registry.json`;
- the project has `.codex/goals/<goal-id>/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`;
- `goal-harness status` shows the goal and who should act next;
- local runtime state is ignored, not committed.

Maintainers can validate the public fresh-clone path with:

```bash
python3 examples/fresh-clone-quickstart-smoke.py
```

## Manual Install

Install one shared local checkout manually when you want to drive setup without
an agent:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangruiteng/goal-harness ~/goal-harness
~/goal-harness/scripts/install-local.sh
goal-harness doctor
```

The installer creates:

- `~/.local/bin/goal-harness`, pointing at a stable local release snapshot;
- `~/.local/bin/goal-harness-canary`, pointing at the live checkout;
- the Goal Harness Codex skills under `~/.codex/skills`.

Those global skills are the intended product surface for reusable Goal Harness
agent behavior; project-specific state and private decisions stay in the local
registry and active goal files.

Use the canary wrapper for one or two selected controllers before promoting a
checkout to the default local release.

## Connect A Project Manually

From the project repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
goal-harness bootstrap \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --objective "Improve this project through bounded, verified goal segments." \
  --goal-doc GOAL.md
```

`connect` is an alias for `bootstrap`:

```bash
goal-harness connect --goal-id your-project-goal
```

This creates or connects:

```text
your-project/
  .goal-harness/registry.json
  .codex/goals/your-project-goal/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md

~/.codex/goal-harness/
  goals/<goal-id>/runs/
```

Treat live goal state and registries as local runtime data. Add these paths to
the connected project `.gitignore` before committing:

```gitignore
.goal-harness/
.codex/goals/
goals/**/ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md
```

Commit only sanitized templates or examples, not a controller's live
`ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`.

## Diagnose From Your Agent

Users should not need to run diagnostic commands by hand. Ask your Codex,
Claude Code, Cursor, or terminal agent:

```text
Diagnose Goal Harness for this project end to end. Do not ask me to run shell
commands.

If `goal-harness` is missing, install or repair it first. Then run
`goal-harness diagnose` yourself, read the diagnostic packet, and use your own
reasoning to tell me:
- whether this project can currently self-drive;
- what evidence supports that answer;
- what is blocking it, if anything;
- the exact question I need to answer, if a user/controller gate exists;
- what you will do next.

Do not treat Goal Harness machine signals as the final verdict. They are
evidence for your diagnosis.
```

`goal-harness diagnose` is intentionally an agent-facing evidence packet. It
collects compact `status`, `quota should-run`, todo, interaction-contract, and
boundary signals, then gives the agent a reasoning checklist. The agent makes
the diagnosis in natural language.

If you want to try Goal Harness before connecting a real repo, create a
disposable demo goal:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
goal-harness demo
```

Expected first-run signals:

- the output contains `ok: True`;
- a project-local registry and active goal state were created under
  `/tmp/goal-harness-demo`;
- one user todo and one agent todo are visible;
- `refresh-state` appended a compact run;
- `quota should-run` returns `should_run=True` and `state=eligible`.

Inspect the demo:

```bash
cd /tmp/goal-harness-demo
goal-harness status
goal-harness quota should-run --goal-id demo-goal
goal-harness history --goal-id demo-goal
```

## Daily Workflow

Inspect installation and registry health:

```bash
goal-harness doctor
goal-harness registry
goal-harness check --scan-root .
```

Read status and history:

```bash
goal-harness status
goal-harness history --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Add explicit work:

```bash
goal-harness todo add \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --role user \
  --text "Review the owner checklist."

goal-harness todo add \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --role agent \
  --text "Summarize the safe read-only evidence." \
  --task-class advancement_task \
  --action-kind evidence_summary
```

Complete an agent todo and atomically add the next executable item:

```bash
goal-harness todo complete \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --todo-id todo_ab12cd34ef56 \
  --evidence "Validated with examples/demo-cli-smoke.py" \
  --next-agent-todo "Run the next bounded validation slice." \
  --next-task-class advancement_task \
  --next-action-kind validation \
  --execute
```

Append a state-only refresh after local state or docs change:

```bash
goal-harness refresh-state --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Generate a compact handoff packet for an agent:

```bash
goal-harness review-packet --goal-id your-project-goal
```

Record an operator gate decision or run-bound reward:

```bash
goal-harness operator-gate \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --decision approve \
  --reason-summary "Approve read-only map opt-in"

goal-harness reward \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --decision continue_route \
  --reward positive \
  --reason-summary "validation improved and the route is worth extending"
```

## Heartbeats And Quota

Quota is compute eligibility, not strategy. It answers whether an automatic
turn may run now, and what kind of turn is allowed.

```bash
goal-harness quota status
goal-harness quota plan
goal-harness quota should-run --goal-id your-project-goal
```

The `next_automatic_turn` reported by `quota plan` is only an advisory
scheduling hint: it chooses the highest-compute eligible goal, while
operator-gated, focus-waiting, waiting, throttled, paused, and health-blocked
goals stay out of the eligible lane.

`quota should-run` returns the machine contract a heartbeat should obey:

- `should_run`: whether delivery work may run now;
- `waiting_on`: user, controller, Codex, external evidence, health, or quota;
- `work_lane_contract`: the next executable lane or monitor/blocker lane;
- `execution_obligation`: whether the agent must attempt a bounded segment;
- user and agent todo summaries;
- safe-bypass or self-repair hints, when enabled;
- the exact spend policy.

Agent todo summaries separate `first_executable_items` from
`monitor_open_items`: executable items drive the selected goal's primary
action, while monitor items stay visible as supplemental observation context
and only spend compute when they produce a material transition or blocker.

Registry entries can expose per-goal `control_plane` policy. For example,
`control_plane.self_repair.enabled=true` lets `quota should-run` return a
bounded `decision=self_repair` contract for repairable control-plane stalls;
missing policy defaults off, so other goals keep their normal skip or wait
behavior.

If `quota should-run` returns a `gate_prompt` or `operator_question`, the
target heartbeat should proactively ask that concrete user/controller gate. If
open user todos are present, do not call the turn "no new user action" while
they remain open; its report still has to list existing open user todos.

When `safe_bypass_allowed=true`, the heartbeat may still do one bounded
read-only steering or analysis step that is independent of the blocked gate.
See [quota allocation](../quota-allocation.md) for the full allocation
contract.

After an automatic turn actually spends delivery compute, append one spend
event:

```bash
goal-harness quota spend-slot \
  --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --slots 1 \
  --source heartbeat \
  --execute
```

Do not append spend for quiet `should_run=false` skips, preflight failures, or
pure dry-run previews.

Generate a guarded Codex App heartbeat body:

```bash
goal-harness heartbeat-prompt --thin --goal-id your-project-goal
```

For shared-control-plane agents, pass identity and scope in the automation
prompt, then let the agent soft-claim matching todos with a registered
`--claimed-by` id:

```bash
goal-harness configure-goal --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --registered-agent codex-main-control \
  --registered-agent codex-side-bypass \
  --primary-agent codex-main-control \
  --execute

goal-harness heartbeat-prompt --compact --goal-id your-project-goal \
  --agent-id codex-side-bypass \
  --agent-scope "control-plane coordination"
```

Once `coordination.registered_agents` is set, `heartbeat-prompt` fails closed
when called without `--agent-id`; this makes stale Codex App automations
surface an upgrade error instead of silently running without identity or
scope. Old goal registries without `coordination.registered_agents` also fail
closed when a scoped heartbeat or todo claim names an agent; register the agent
identity first instead of letting workers invent claim ids.

Set exactly one `coordination.primary_agent`: that primary agent owns final
review, verification, merge, publication, and high-risk side-agent review. Side
agents are prompted to work in separate worktrees, and `quota should-run
--agent-id <side-agent-id>` fails closed with `workspace_guard` when a side
agent runs from the primary checkout. Small AGENTS-eligible
validated changes may be self-merged with explicit Goal Harness evidence;
higher-risk or unclear work should still be handed back through a primary
review todo.

See [heartbeat automation prompt](../heartbeat-automation-prompt.md) and
[project agent todo contract](../project-agent-todo-contract.md).

## Dashboard

Dashboard status is an experimental operator preview. The CLI and
`goal-harness status` remain the canonical daily workflow; the React dashboard
is useful for demos, public-safe fixtures, and local inspection.

Serve status JSON:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --port 8765
```

Run the dashboard:

```bash
cd ~/goal-harness/apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

For the shared multi-project view:

```bash
goal-harness serve-status --global-registry --port 8766 --limit 80
```

On macOS, keep the global feed and built dashboard running after login:

```bash
~/goal-harness/scripts/macos-dashboard-launchagent.sh install
~/goal-harness/scripts/macos-dashboard-launchagent.sh status
```

The dashboard should answer, before raw log drill-down:

- what the human needs to judge;
- what Codex can do next;
- what is waiting on evidence;
- what boundary cannot be crossed yet.

See [apps/dashboard/README.md](../../apps/dashboard/README.md).

## Public / Private Boundary

Safe to publish:

- registry schema and runtime layout;
- adapter lifecycle and generic control-plane contracts;
- sanitized examples and smoke fixtures;
- generic validation commands.

Keep private:

- real local paths;
- task ids and internal document links;
- production logs and raw experiment metrics;
- credentials and auth material;
- user-specific active goal state and local registries;
- raw agent sessions or benchmark traces.

Run the public/private scan before publishing docs or examples:

```bash
goal-harness check \
  --scan-path README.md \
  --scan-path docs/ \
  --scan-path examples/
```

See [public/private boundary](../public-private-boundary.md).

## Development

Run the focused CLI and contract smokes from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile goal_harness/*.py
python3 examples/demo-cli-smoke.py
python3 examples/todo-cli-smoke.py
python3 examples/todo-lifecycle-cli-smoke.py
python3 examples/quota-contract-smoke.py
python3 examples/review-packet-cli-smoke.py
python3 examples/benchmark-run-v0-append-cli-smoke.py
git diff --check
```

For dashboard work:

```bash
cd apps/dashboard
npm install
npm run build
npm run smoke:demo-readiness
```

For release-promotion readiness:

```bash
python3 examples/canary-promotion-readiness-smoke.py
goal-harness promotion-gate --format json
goal-harness upgrade-plan --format json
```

## Repository Quality Guard

This repository should stay readable to a new contributor. Treat these as
periodic maintainer checks:

- the README first screen explains the product before internal operations;
- quick start commands still run on a clean checkout;
- live local state is not committed;
- public/private scan is clean before docs or examples are published;
- docs linked from the README still exist and describe current CLI behavior;
- smoke commands cover the highest-risk control-plane contracts.
