# Architecture

Goal Harness has seven layers.

1. **Registry**: lists known goals, their repos, adapters, authority sources,
   status, and guards.
2. **Goal state**: the active state file for one goal.
3. **Adapter pre-tick**: a read-only project-specific probe.
4. **Run log**: JSON and Markdown reports saved per goal.
5. **Run history**: compact indexes consumed by agents, heartbeats, and UI.
6. **Status / attention queue**: first-screen summary of who needs to act next.
7. **Compute quota**: local policy for how much automatic agent compute each
   goal may consume.

The core repository intentionally avoids domain logic. A data experiment goal,
a note-maintenance goal, and a harness self-improvement goal should share the
same runtime and contract, but use different adapters.

Goal Harness should still absorb field-tested project-control mechanisms such
as authority registries, current-belief TODOs, managed external-source
manifests, experiment boards, validation surface maps, and gated handoff
packets. See [field-derived-patterns.md](field-derived-patterns.md).

## State Interaction Model

Goal Harness has four product actors:

- the **goal**, which owns durable objective, state, guards, run history, and
  reward overlays;
- the **Codex App executor**, which performs bounded transitions but should not
  be the long-term source of truth;
- the **user**, who supplies operator intent, approval, and high-quality reward
  signals;
- the **dashboard**, which visualizes derived status and should remain
  read-mostly unless an explicit local write boundary is enabled.

This actor model is the design gate for future commands and dashboard work. A
new capability should name the state it reads, the state it writes, the owner
of that write, and how the dashboard proves the transition happened.

See [state-interaction-model.md](state-interaction-model.md).

## Controller / Sub-Agent Model

For Codex-style parallel work, Goal Harness treats the main goal run as a
controller run. The controller owns:

- the objective and active goal state,
- the decision to spawn sub-agents,
- write-scope assignment,
- merge or rejection of child results,
- final validation, public/private scan, and state writeback.

Sub-agents own bounded child work:

- read-only repo exploration,
- one implementation slice with a disjoint write scope,
- one validation or benchmark surface,
- one risk or boundary check.

Goal Harness does not replace the operating-system scheduler or Codex App
executor. It should, however, own the simple compute quota that those executors
read before running more work. Timer cadence is an execution mechanism, not the
product source of truth for project priority.

See [quota-allocation.md](quota-allocation.md).

See [codex-subagent-orchestration.md](codex-subagent-orchestration.md).

## Status / Attention Queue

The status layer derives a compact queue from registry, run history, and
contract health. It should be the first thing a controller or future UI reads:

- contract failures block adapter work,
- goals waiting on user/controller opt-in are surfaced explicitly,
- goals ready for Codex work are separated from external evidence watches,
- already-connected read-only goals with valid runs do not keep demanding
  redundant review.

See [attention-queue.md](attention-queue.md).

The JSON export is the boundary for dashboards, heartbeat summaries, and future
UI work. See [status-data-contract.md](status-data-contract.md). The product
dashboard frontend should follow
[dashboard-frontend-selection.md](dashboard-frontend-selection.md); the
single-file HTML renderer remains a fallback for smoke tests and offline
inspection.
