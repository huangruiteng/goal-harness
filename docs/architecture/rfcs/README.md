# Architecture RFCs

Architecture RFCs are public design proposals. Each RFC should name its
decision boundary, non-goals, smallest useful implementation slice, and
validation criteria. An RFC may describe future work; current behavior is
defined by the implementation and stable reference contracts.

The [Current Technical Directions](../../project/technical-directions.md) page
maps RFCs to strategic programs, contribution routes, and promotion gates.

## How to read this index

The sections below are technical ownership areas, not maturity levels. Each
primary RFC appears once under its nearest architectural owner even when it
also affects other areas.

Within each entry, RFC maturity and delivery maturity remain separate facts:

- **RFC status** records the decision state written in the RFC. `Draft` work
  remains open to architectural change even when a bounded slice has shipped.
- **Delivery on `main`** records the implementation state audited against the
  repository. A merged experiment does not make its whole RFC accepted, and an
  accepted RFC may still have later adoption work.
- **Current boundary** names what is real now and what is still excluded. It is
  a navigation aid, not a replacement for stable protocol documentation.

This index was last audited against `main` on **2026-09-02**. Update an entry
whenever its RFC status, promoted behavior, or meaningful delivery boundary
changes.

## Control-Plane Kernel, State, And Migration

- [Agent Loop Effect Interpreter v0](agent-loop-effect-interpreter-v0.md)
  ([中文版](agent-loop-effect-interpreter-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Accepted.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Core implemented; bounded adoption continues.
  - **Current boundary:** Effect request, interpretation, observation,
    settlement, and typed Effect Program foundations are shipped. Replan
    planning/ACK stays domain-local until a second real lifecycle justifies
    extraction.
- [TypeScript Control-Plane Migration v0](typescript-control-plane-migration-v0.md)
  ([中文版](typescript-control-plane-migration-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Accepted; transaction-payoff phase in progress.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Substantially implemented; active migration.
  - **Current boundary:** Stage 1 and 2A are complete. Stage 2B is cutting over
    whole semantic transactions and retiring Python facades under parity and
    differential gates.
- [Shared-goal Online Authority and Pluggable Coordination Provider v0](shared-goal-authority-state-provider-v0.md)
  ([中文版](shared-goal-authority-state-provider-v0.zh-CN.md),
  [validation boundary](shared-goal-authority-state-provider-v0-evidence.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Draft, under maintainer review.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Foundation and provider-contract slices
    implemented.
  - **Current boundary:** Recoverable shared-authority foundations, the
    file-backed reference path, NoKV shadow/recovery evidence, and the
    TypeScript store contract are on `main`
    ([#3529](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3529),
    [#3669](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3669),
    [#3798](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3798)). No remote
    provider is the promoted authority; PostgreSQL remains planned.
- [Goal Artifact Lifecycle Projection v0](goal-artifact-lifecycle-projection-v0.md)
  ([中文版](goal-artifact-lifecycle-projection-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Draft, under maintainer review.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Proposal only.
  - **Current boundary:** Milestones, blocking guards, and legal transitions are
    specified as a read-only projection; no canonical lifecycle projection has
    shipped.

## Planning, Research, And Adaptive Intelligence

  - **Current boundary:** The explicit composition projection and successor
    binding from M2 shipped in
    [#3173](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3173). The canonical

    [#3290](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3290). Adaptive effect,
    delivery, and authority stride selection remains research-only.
- [Post-Outcome Memory Utility Attribution v0](post-outcome-memory-utility-attribution-v0.md)
  ([中文版](post-outcome-memory-utility-attribution-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Draft, under maintainer review.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Stage 1 implemented.
  - **Current boundary:**
    [#3280](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3280) binds utility
    observations to verified outcomes without changing retrieval ranking.
    Reducer/read projection, provider readback, ranking influence, and pilot

    shipped as an integrated path.

## Operator Experience And Observability

- [Per-Goal Usage, Token, and Cost Surfacing v0](goal-usage-token-cost-v0.md)
  - **RFC status:** Draft.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Core slice implemented.
  - **Current boundary:** Codex usage capture, normalized aggregation, and
    dashboard surfacing shipped in
    [#3117](https://github.com/huangruiteng/loopx/pull/3117); broader
    runtime/provider coverage and cost semantics remain incomplete.

  ([中文版](intelligent-review-presentation-surfaces-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Draft, under maintainer review.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Proposal only.
  - **Current boundary:** Existing typed proposals, gates, planning projections,
    receipts, and direct reversible-action UX are inputs. The shared
    `action_review_plan_v0` compiler and dynamic card/report/wiki presentation
    contract have not shipped.
- [Human Attention Wishlist v0](human-attention-wishlist-v0.md)
  ([中文版](human-attention-wishlist-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Draft, under maintainer review.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Intentionally deferred.
  - **Current boundary:** The RFC remains a discussion contract. Runtime work is
    held until repeated real usage demonstrates a second need without weakening
    non-blocking authority boundaries.

## Benchmark And Reliability Engineering

- [Long-Horizon Harness Benchmark and Research Program v0](long-horizon-harness-benchmark-research-program-v0.md)
  ([中文版](long-horizon-harness-benchmark-research-program-v0.zh-CN.md))
  - **RFC status:** Draft, research program.
  - **Delivery on `main`:** Active research and engineering program.

    qualification, and governed delivery package are proposed; no unified
    product contract has been promoted.

RFCs must not contain internal conversations, private links, local filesystem
paths, credentials, raw transcripts, or non-public organizational context.
